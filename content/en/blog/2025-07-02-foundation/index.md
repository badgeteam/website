Badge.Team has recently formalized into a foundation. By having a legal entity in place we can provide better support to our volunteers and run our projects with more stability while still doing the thing we love most: creating and maintaining awesome event badges. 

One of the big new things our new structure enables is the separation of creating cool proof of concepts and the creation of a product for a specific event. If you have a cool badge idea or an idea for a cool badge feature be sure to get in touch!

## Future projects

The first product we are going to make under the new foundation umbrella is the badge for Hackerhotel. We are working on a LoRa communicator device, the financial and sponsoring side is still being worked out so we don't know yet what the final product will be like but we will keep everyone informed of the progress.

If you're organizing a volunteer run event and considering a badge, we encourage you to reach out. We can provide support ranging from consultancy, hardware and firmware development and even helping out with organizing manufacturing. Whether you want something simple or deeply custom, we're open to collaboration.

## Reference designs

We have some cool reference designs in the works too which you might want to check out:

### [Konsool](/docs/badges/konsool/)
The portable computer you wish you had in the 80\`s. Complete with on-device programming environment, a high resolution, 60Hz screen and a full QWERTY keyboard. This device is all the computing power you will need on a hand held hackable device!

### Kami
A modern, completely redesigned and modernized version of the first project we did: the SHA2017 badge.
