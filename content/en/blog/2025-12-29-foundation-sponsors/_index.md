# Happy New year

A huge thank you to our sponsors – You help make Badge.Team possible!

At Badge.Team, we work on building open, playful, and hacker-friendly technology that sparks creativity and connects the community.
Whether it's through custom hardware, firmware projects, or community experiences we help power, none of it would be possible without the contributions of our sponsors.

We would like to express our gratitude towards all who contributed in the past year, your contributions make it possible for us to keep enriching the community with wonderful badges, and be a home for those who have the desire to create, use, and want to learn about badges.

Without your support we would have been able to become a foundation.
We are working on several projects for events next year, and the year, after, please feel free to join our Discord see the projects, and interact with the badge community.

## Creating possibilities

Our sponsors are more than just logos on a banner.
Their support allows us to:

- Design inspiring event badges
- Connect makers
- Prototype/gain experience with new and/or interesting technologies
- Host community events at conferences and hacker camps
- Share knowledge and spark new projects
- Keep projects open-source and accessible

## Thank You

To our sponsors: thank you for believing in us. Your support means the world to us and the community

We wish you all a happy and healthy new year,

### — With ❤️ Badge.Team
