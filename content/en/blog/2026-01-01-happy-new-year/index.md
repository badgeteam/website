Happy new year hackers! A new year means new exciting projects... This year you will see us at Bornhack with an awesome new event badge, but this blog is about something even more important.

## Our sponsors

A huge thank you to our sponsors – You help make Badge.Team possible!

At Badge.Team, we work on building open, playful, and hacker-friendly technology that sparks creativity and connects the community.
Whether it's through custom hardware, firmware projects, or community experiences we help power, none of it would be possible without the contributions of our sponsors.

We would like to express our gratitude towards all who contributed in the past years, your contributions make it possible for us to keep enriching the community with wonderful badges, and be a home for those who have the desire to create, use, and want to learn about badges.

Without your support we would not have been able to become a foundation.
We are working on several projects for events this year and even the year after, please feel free to join our Discord stay up-to-date with what is happening and interact with the badge community.
