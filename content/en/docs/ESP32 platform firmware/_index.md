{{% alert title="Warning" color="warning" %}}
This section describes the now deprecated "ESP32 platform firmware". For most of our ESP32 based badges this firmware is the latest available while we're working on adding support for all our older badges. The MCH2022 badge shipped with a more recent MicroPython fork we call BadgePython. If you're looking for information on Python for the MCH2022 badge please check the BadgePython section instead.
