| add_handler        | handler                    | - | Registers a handler function, that is called any time a keypad button is pressed or released. The first argument is the key index (0 top left, 3 top right, 12 bottom left, etc.), and the second argument is whether the button is currently pressed or not.                                                    |
| remove_handler     | handler                    | - | Removes previously registered handler function, so it won't be called anymore.                                                    |
| get_state          | -                          | touch_state | Returns a list of 16 booleans indicating for each button whether they are currently pressed.                                                    |
