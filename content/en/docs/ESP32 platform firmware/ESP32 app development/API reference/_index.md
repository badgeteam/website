Welcome to the API reference for the Badge.team platform firmware.

This reference describes all officially supported APIs of our platform. We try to keep these APIs as stable as possible. There are many more (undocumented) APIs in the firmware, all of which may change at any time!

Our platform firmware uses MicroPython at it's core. Most of the libraries and APIs from the upstream MicroPython project are available in the Badge.team firmware.

The [MicroPython documentation](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest) describes the builtin [libraries](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/library) and [functions](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/library/builtins.html).

Specifically, the MicroPython core in our firmware is based on the ESP32 port of MicroPython by [Loboris](https://github.com/loboris/MicroPython_ESP32_psRAM_LoBo). He changed some parts of MicroPython to suit the ESP32 better. The [wiki](https://github.com/loboris/MicroPython_ESP32_psRAM_LoBo/wiki) of his project describes the changes he made.

We have made a lot of changes on top of the work done by Loboris. We've added some badge specific APIs, a brand new framebuffer system for displaying graphics and drivers for the hardware specific to the supported badges.

By doing this we aim to take the resource intensive parts of driving the hardware to the C level beneath Python. This allows for a much more speedy experience and a lot more possibilities and flexibility.

### Things to keep in mind while looking up documentation

 - There is currently no API available for directly controlling the SPI bus(ses) of your badge from within Python.
 - I2C should be used with caution as the I2C bus on most badges is used for system peripherals as well.
 - The Neopixel (LED) driver differs greatly from the neopixel API in the Loboris port.
 - The Display driver differs greatly from the display API in the Loboris port.

If you want to help with firmware development please tell us! We're always happy to accept PRs and improvements.

Should you have ideas, problems or observations but no means to act on them then you can always [create an issue on Github](https://github.com/badgeteam/ESP32-platform-firmware/issues).
