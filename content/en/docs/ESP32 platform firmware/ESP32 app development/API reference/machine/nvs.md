This page describes the Non-Volatile-Storage (NVS) functions of the machine API. This NVS is used to store settings such as WiFi credentials and your nickname.

The NVS storage is a function of the ESP-IDF which allows for settings to be stored in a special partition on the flash of the ESP32 and is ment for small quantities of data.
If you want to store large(er) amounts of data we suggest you use the filesystem functions of MicroPython to store your data on the FAT partition instead.
