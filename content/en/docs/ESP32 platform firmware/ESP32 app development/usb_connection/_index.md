You can communicate with your badge when it is not sleeping.

You can use a terminal application such as picocom to start talking to your
badge. Hit '?' to open the text menu, which you can use to enter a
micropython shell.

You can use tools like ampy and mpfshell to transfer files between your PC
and the badge, and execute python code from there. Sometimes you need a couple
attempts for a request to succeed.
