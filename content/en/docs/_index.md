# MCH2022 is over, but The Badge lives on!

To [everyone who worked on the project](/team/), be it in
the past months or 1,5 years ago when we were still aiming for MCH2021: you
rock! We have received so many compliments on the design, the soft-/firmware,
the day 1 readiness, the website & docs, the specs and the overall end result:
whatever you did to contribute, you can be proud to be or to have been part of
this.  

To our [sponsors](https://github.com/badgeteam/mch2022-sponsors-slideshow) and
the people who arranged the sponsorships: we couldn't have done it without you.
To everyone who made apps or mods during camp: thank you for giving The Badge
its purpose. We hope to see even more in the future.  To everyone here: thank
you for being here, sharing our hype, giving your input and for making cool
things with the badge.

To those who are **missing something** in their badge kit: we'll work something
out. We have some batteries and lots of tangle strip (velcro) left. Update
Soon™ To those who **want an extra badge**: they will probably be sold in the
ticket shop, we'll share an update once we know more.

Please [**keep in touch**](/docs/badges/mch2022/support/), don't put The Badge
in a drawer, keep learning and hacking! We'll be around for questions, fixes,
improvements.

## Now back to our regular programming.
In all likelihood you came here because you want to learn how to get the most
out of your MCH2022 Badge...

## In case you're here for another badge ...  

Uups, apologies. Don't forget that this site caters to quite a number of events
that have badges built on the same technology, in case you received such a
badge and are looking for pointers on how to use it, please proceed to [choose
your badge](badges).

All resource on this site are works-in-progress. Please let us know if you find
any errors or run into corner that could be explained more clearly by opening
an [issue](https://github.com/badgeteam/website/issues) or [pull
request](https://github.com/badgeteam/website/pulls) in the documentation
[website repo](https://github.com/badgeteam/website/). For example, this page
should revert to being a generic badge documentation site after
[MCH2022](https://wiki.mch2022.org/Main_Page).  Thanks!
