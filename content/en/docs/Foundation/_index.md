Stichting Badge.Team is a foundation registered in the Netherlands under KVK entry number 97292931.

Weâ€™re a constantly changing group of volunteers that aims to take creating event badges to the next level! Are you planning on making an event badge for a volunteer run hacker community event? We'd love to work with you. Stichting Badge.Team helps badge development teams by providing legal, financial and archival support for these community projects. We aim to facilitate the creation of high quality event badge gadgets while preventing burnt out hero situations like we've seen too many times in the past.

## How can Badge.Team help you and your team?

We provide various reference designs for (parts of) event badges. Have an awesome idea for a badge but having difficulty figuring out the power circuitry? Look no further.

Not looking forward to writing boring boilerplate firmware? We have a ready to use launcher firmware and board support package ready to use for ESP-IDF (ESP32 family) based badges. Simply add device drivers for your display and input methods and the framework does the rest.

In addition to reference hard- and software designs we can also help out with schematic and board review and other general support. Join our telegram group and ask away to get in touch.

## Not sure where to start with organizing your event badge project?

Get in touch to see if your project is a good fit for being ran under the Badge.Team flag, in this situation we can assist with component sourcing, ask our sponsor contacts for free or cheap parts and guide your event organization towards having manufacturing being taken care of by our trusted manufacturing partner in China.
