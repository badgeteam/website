Welcome to the API reference for BadgePython.

This reference describes all officially supported APIs of our platform. We try to keep these APIs as stable as possible. There are many more (undocumented) APIs in the firmware, all of which may change at any time!

BadgePython uses MicroPython at it's core.The libraries and APIs from the upstream MicroPython project are available in BadgePython.

The [MicroPython documentation](https://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.18/) describes the builtin [libraries](https://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.18/library/index.html) and [functions](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/library/builtins.html).


We've added some badge specific APIs for efficiently controlling hardware like the display and reading the buttons. By implementing the resource intensive parts of driving the hardware in C. This allows for a much more speedy experience and a lot more possibilities and flexibility.

If you want to help with firmware development please tell us! We're always happy to accept PRs and improvements.

Should you have ideas, problems or observations but no means to act on them then you can always [create an issue on Github](https://github.com/badgeteam/BadgePython/issues).
