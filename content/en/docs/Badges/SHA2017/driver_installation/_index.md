The SHA2017 badge uses a Silicon Labs CP2102 USB to serial converter for communication with your computer.

You can find the driver for this chip on the [Silicon Labs website](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers).

The badge expects you to connect to it at *115200* baud. Note that the badge will not respond when in sleep mode. After connecting over USB be sure to wake the badge up either by touching one of the touch buttons or by pressing the RESET button on the back.
