# Navigation

### Moving around in the launcher

- Navigation is done using the arrow keys to navigate the menus.
- An item can be activated by pressing the 'enter' key.

### Returning back to the launcher

Exiting an application back to the launcher should be done using: the red '<span style="color: red">X</span>' function button, which is located next to the escape.

When a program is started, basically a new firmware image is loaded into the ESP32-P4 so this will not work for all applications.
Applications that behave well should support this though, and should return to the launcher.
