## Limitations & warnings

 - Total for all 3.3v outputs must not exceed 1A of current. It is generally adviced to stay well below this figure.
 - VSDCARD power rail can supply at most 100mA total to both the SD card and the expansion header.
 - Do not exceed a current of 1A from or to the battery when the battery is connected to the internal battery connector.
