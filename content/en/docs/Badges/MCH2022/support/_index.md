You're on the main documentation site for The Badge.

We hope that we'll be able to centralize all documentation efforts here,
but who knows what happens at camps.

We would be very happy to accept pull request (TODO link to how to make a
good PR) if you find the documentation lacking and feel you are able to
make improvements. The documentation project lives in this [github
repository](https://github.com/badgeteam/website)
