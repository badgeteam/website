## Welcome

The badge contains an ice40 FPGA that is connected to a PMOD connector, a serial QSPI
RAM, and a RGB LED.  It can also control the display over a parallel bus, and
has an USB UART link via the RP2040 and an SPI link to the ESP32 which notifies the FPGA
on the state of the buttons and offers read access to large data files.

You can start with having a look at the
[top-level diagram of the badge hardware](../../hardware) of the complete badge,
then proceed to the  [schematic](https://github.com/badgeteam/mch2022-badge-hardware/blob/master/schematic.pdf)
and [pin constraints file](https://github.com/badgeteam/mch2022-firmware-ice40/blob/master/projects/_common/data/mch2022-proto4.pcf).


## Quickstart

As with all the other methods to program the badge, step one is to download
[mch2022-tools](https://github.com/badgeteam/mch2022-tools/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).
There are two main tools to use here, `python3 webusb_fpga.py bitstream.bin`
which will upload a bitstream directly into the FPGA, and `python3
webusb_fat_push.py bitsream.bin /sdcard/apps/ice40/myapp/bitstream.bin` which
will make the bitstream available in the launcher.

The easiest way to install the tools needed to synthesise bitstreams for the FPGA is
[oss-cad-suite](https://github.com/YosysHQ/oss-cad-suite-build/releases).

You can also build [Yosys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/), [Icestorm](https://github.com/YosysHQ/icestorm),
and [NextPNR](https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr/) from source.

Do not try to install packaged Yosys/NextPNR/Icestorm tools that might come with your distro -- the toolchain is advancing very, very quick, and if your distro packaged it three months ago, it is already heavily outdated. The ones in Debian Stable -- Ouch!

The main repository with templates and examples is
[mch2022-firmware-ice40](https://github.com/badgeteam/mch2022-firmware-ice40).
Running `make` in any of the folders in the `projects` directory should produce
a bitstream in separate `build-tmp` subfolder.
Also take note of the `cores` folder, which contains many useful
cores for basic functionality, such as providing the FPGA as a peripheral to
the ESP via SPI and others.

The FPGA can kind of be used in two seperate modes: standalone and peripheral mode.

## Standalone

When launching a bitstream from the launcher, the ESP32 hands over control of
the display to the FPGA, and exposes an API for reading buttons and files.

A simple example to read the buttons is found in
[buttons.v](https://github.com/badgeteam/mch2022-firmware-ice40/blob/master/projects/Buttons/rtl/buttons.v)

A more elaborate example of a full-fledged RISC-V SoC with a wishbone bus and
video output can be found in
[riscv_doom](https://github.com/badgeteam/mch2022-firmware-ice40/tree/master/projects/riscv_doom).
While the example is runing Doom, but it's actually a full featured RISC-V
processor so it's possible to change the RISC-V code running on it, add or
modify peripherals on the wishbone bus, etc.

The [file read interface](https://github.com/badgeteam/mch2022-firmware-ice40/blob/master/cores/spi_slave/rtl/spi_dev_fread.v)
uses data files either temporarily uploaded along with the bitstream you are currently working on as `webusb_fpga.py riscv-playground.bin 0xdabbad00:fw/tinyblinky/tinyblinky.bin` or put into the filesystem as `fpga_dabbad00.dat` in the same folder as the bitstream itself.
You can use multiple data files with different 32-bit hexadecimal file identifiers.

## Hints

If you want to think of the badge solely as FPGA dev board, you can ignore most of its other functionality, just keep in mind these handy hints:

* The two UART lines are routed to `/dev/ttyACM1`, your terminal program selects the baud rate.

* The FPGA should control the RGB LED using the SB_RGBA_DRV hard macro with constant current capabilities instead of a simple Verilog outputs, as that would overdrive at least the red LED.

* The FPGA shall wait for then `lcd_mode` pin that switches between SPI/parallel mode of the LCD to go high before starting to talk to the LCD, as it is driven by the ESP32.

* Check twice before connecting external voltages to the PMOD :-)

## Example projects for standalone mode

This is a list of Verilog examples available in [https://github.com/badgeteam/mch2022-firmware-ice40/](https://github.com/badgeteam/mch2022-firmware-ice40/).

There is also a collection of examples written in Silice: [https://github.com/sylefeb/mch2022-silice](https://github.com/sylefeb/mch2022-silice).

### Blinkies

Three different blinkies are available for a bright first experience:

* [Hello-World](https://github.com/badgeteam/mch2022-firmware-ice40/tree/master/projects/Hello-World) Completely new to FPGAs? Start here!
* [Fading-White](https://github.com/badgeteam/mch2022-firmware-ice40/tree/master/projects/Fading-White) Smoother blinking than just on-off.
* [Fading-RGB](https://github.com/badgeteam/mch2022-firmware-ice40/tree/master/projects/Fading-RGB) Smooth with colors!

### Buttons

A small [example](https://github.com/badgeteam/mch2022-firmware-ice40/tree/master/projects/Buttons) on how to get the state of the buttons. This is not trivial as the buttons are not connected to the FPGA.

### Ledcomm

A light emitting diode can shine, but it can also detect light. This contains an [UART <-> Ledcomm bridge](https://github.com/badgeteam/mch2022-firmware-ice40/tree/master/projects/Ledcomm) that allows one to transfer data between two badges just using a pair of LEDs. Still confused? Read the original paper [https://merl.com/publications/docs/TR2003-35.pdf](https://merl.com/publications/docs/TR2003-35.pdf).

### Forth Pmod Lab

Soldered something special for the Pmod connector? The [Forth Pmod Lab](https://github.com/badgeteam/mch2022-firmware-ice40/tree/master/projects/Forth) helps you to quickly examine your hardware using the Forth language. Due to [extensive documentation](https://github.com/badgeteam/mch2022-firmware-ice40/blob/master/projects/Forth/README) also suitable if you want to try Forth for the first time.

### Snake

A free interpretation of the classic ["snake" game](https://github.com/badgeteam/mch2022-firmware-ice40/tree/master/projects/Snake) with ASCII art and a Ledcomm based two-player mode. Enjoy!

### RISCV-Playground

A complete beginner friendly RISC-V 'fantasy microcontroller' that deserves [its own documentation](../risc-v).

### Doom

Does it run [Doom](https://github.com/badgeteam/mch2022-firmware-ice40/tree/master/projects/riscv_doom)? Of course!


## Peripheral mode

Both the C++ and the Python API contain a convenience function to load a
bitstream into the FPGA from your ESP32 program.  This allows the FPGA to be
used as a peripheral for the ESP32 processor, think AI coprocessor, bitcoin
mining, HDMI output...

A great way to get started with this is to use the
[spi_skeleton](https://github.com/badgeteam/mch2022-firmware-ice40/tree/master/projects/spi_skeleton)
example, which exposes a [wishbone
bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wishbone_(computer_bus)) to the ESP32 over
SPI.

This mode could be used to add an UART port on the PMOD by adding the
following code, adjusting the top level ports and incrementing `WN`.

```verilog
	// UART [2]
	// ----

	uart_wb #(
		.DIV_WIDTH(12),
		.DW(32)
	) uart_I (
		.uart_tx  (uart_tx),
		.uart_rx  (uart_rx),
		.wb_addr  (wb_addr[1:0]),
		.wb_rdata (wb_rdata[2]),
		.wb_we    (wb_we),
		.wb_wdata (wb_wdata),
		.wb_cyc   (wb_cyc[2]),
		.wb_ack   (wb_ack[2]),
		.clk      (clk),
		.rst      (rst)
	);

```

On the ESP32 you could then write the following Python script that loads a
bitstream and writes to the newly added UART port.

```python
import mch22
from fpga_wishbone import FPGAWB

# load bitstream from SD card onto the FPGA
with open("/sd/apps/ice40/myapp/bitstream.bin", "rb") as f:
    mch22.fpga_load(f.read())

# create a wishbone command buffer
c = FPGAWB()
# setup UART
# (30e6/9600)-2
c.queue_write(2, 4, 3123)
# queue writing a byte
c.queue_write(2, 0, 0xaa)
# queue reading a byte
c.queue_read(2, 0)
# execute the command queue
c.exec()
```

## Example projects for peripheral mode

### Selftest

Badge hardware ok next to the FPGA? The [selftest](https://github.com/badgeteam/mch2022-firmware-ice40/tree/master/projects/selftest) checks for that and reports back to the ESP32.

### SPI-to-RGB

The [SPI to RGB bridge](https://github.com/badgeteam/mch2022-firmware-ice40/tree/master/projects/spi-to-rgb) gives the ESP32 control over the RGB LED, which is directly connected to the FPGA.

## Guide for complete newbies to FPGAs

Let's try for short:

For a bunch of TTL logic chip to do something useful, you need to wire them up - and the way you wire these determines the function of the completed circuit.

A "Field Programmambe Gate Array" contains a grid of "universal gates" called lookup-tables with -in our case- 4 binary inputs and 1 output, and every of these is accompanied by 1 flipflop bit. Nothing special so far. The special sauce of an FPGA is their connection - that there is a dense mesh of wires in different lengths that crisscross the entire chip, with switchbox points that allow to choose how to connect the individual logic elements to the mesh of wires. By selecting which switchboxes to activate, one builds an actual digital circuit on the FPGA.

For your curiosity, here is a DIY FPGA: [http://blog.notdot.net/2012/10/Build-your-own-FPGA](http://blog.notdot.net/2012/10/Build-your-own-FPGA)

You should have an idea by now! You are going to build logic circuits. And you'll probably fall into a rabbit hole :-)

Brains"](fpga-getting-started) guide for step by step information getting from
0 to a hardly working FPGA setup, in case you never heard of FPGAs before.

We would love to give you a more complete intro, but for time-is-not-infinite reasons, recommend you intros from others instead.
