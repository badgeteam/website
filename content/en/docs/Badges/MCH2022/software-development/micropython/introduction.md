# Introduction ...

The Badge comes with a preinstalled Micropython interpreter. Python should be
the easiest way to control the device and write apps for The Badge, especially
if you are a beginner or don't want to spend a lot of time downloading
tools and debugging drivers.

First, make sure Python is installed and you didn't accidentally
delete it. Check in the `apps` menu. If it's not there: install the
Python app from the Hatchery by going to `Hatchery -> ESP32 native
binaries -> Utility -> Python` and install it either onto the flash or
onto an SD card.

If you have it already installed, make sure to check that you have the latest
version via `App update`.

There are several ways to run badgepython and develop badgepython applications.
None of them are particularly well documented, so it's up to you to explore
what you can do and how to do it in a smart way. 

In case you are interested in improving the documentation, we would be very
happy to receive pull requests.

Here are a few starting points:

## Run Python interactively

Start Python on your badge (`apps` -> `Python`). There should be a message on
screen that an interactive Python console is availble on your USB serial
connection. Baud rate is 115200. Connect to it using a serial terminal of your
choice (e.g. `screen /dev/tty.<your_serial> 115200`, you may also use other
terminal emulators such as `PuTTY` or `picocom` based on your OS and/or
preference). The badge typically exposes two serial ports, simply try - one
should give you access to a terminal. If terminal gives a totally black screen, **press enter** to see the prompt appear.

You can now run python interactively. For example, run `print("That was
easy!")`. Amazing! 

```python
$ picocom /dev/ttyACM0 -b 115200
>>> print("That was easy")
That was easy
```

Not only is the terminal a great way to try stuff out, it also allows easy
access to The Badge's file system. Type `import os`, then `os.listdir("/")` to
see the root filesystem. A FAT partition is mounted on the badge's internal
flash at `/`. If you [inserted a MicroSD card](../../../getting-started/sdcard),
its contents will be mounted at `/sd`. You can traverse the directories with
`os.listdir()` (and you will see that Python apps live at
`/apps/python/<appname>/`). You can create and remove directories with
`os.mkdir` and `os.rmdir` and delete files `os.remove`. Don't screw up your
filesystem too badly. More documentation on basic micropython's OS
library is available [in the MicroPython
documentation](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/library/os.html).

Try using the screen: 

```python
>>> import display
>>> display.drawFill(0xFF0000)
>>> display.flush()
```

`display` is a badge-specific module. There are several Badge-specific modules.
You can find documentation on them [api-reference](/docs/esp32-platform-firmware/esp32-app-development/api-reference/) (they might not
be all fully up-to-date, but good enough for a start). In addition there is
also a `mch22` module that offers a few badge-specific APIs. Finding out about
it's features is left as an exercise to the reader (hint: `import mch22`,
`dir(mch22)`).

## Develop microPython apps in the emulator

Uri Shaked a.k.a [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/335445228923126356) built
an awesome emulation of the badge that runs in your browser. This is an amazing
way to quickly get started with app development. It's not as fast as your
badge, but it implements a surprising amount of the peripherals. [Just try
it.](https://wokwi.com/projects/335445228923126356)

## Run an app on the Badge itself

Have a look at your Badge's filesystem and the example apps in the
[Hatchery](https://mch2022.badge.team) (btw: browsing the hatchery is a great
resource for examples). You will see that each app resides in its own directory
`/apps/python/<appname>`. The main entry point is the `__init__.py` script
inside that directory. The directory may contain other python sources and
resource files.  Apps stored in the internal flash reside in `/apps/python`,
apps on the (optional) SD card reside in `/sd/apps/python/`.


Create an app folder on your Badge's filesystem (let's call it
`/apps/python/myapp` in this example).  There are two ways to create a
new app folder for your app: either connect to the BadgePython interactive
shell (`screen`, PuTTY, ...), and create the directory with the `os`
package:

```
>>> import os
>>> os.listdir("/apps/python")
['citycontrol', 'someapp']

>>> os.mkdir("/apps/python/myapp")

>>> os.listdir("/apps/python")
['citycontrol', 'someapp', 'myapp']

```

or use the [mch2022 tools](https://github.com/badgeteam/mch2022-tools) to create a new folder from your laptop:

```bash
$ python webusb_fat_ls.py /flash/apps/python
Booting into WebUSB, please wait ...
transfer speed: 2.32 kb/s
Directory listing for "/flash/apps/python"...
Directory "citycontrol"
Directory "someapp"

$ python webusb_fat_mkdir.py /flash/apps/python/myapp
Starting...
/internal/apps/python/
Succesfully created directory

$ python webusb_fat_ls.py /flash/apps/python
Booting into WebUSB, please wait ...
transfer speed: 20.32 kb/s
Directory listing for "/flash/apps/python"...
Directory "citycontrol"
Directory "someapp"
Directory "myapp"

```

Now it's time to write some code on your laptop using a text editor of your
choice. If you're not sure what and how to program, you can use the following
example:

```python
import display
import random

def drawRandomLine():
  x1 = random.randint(0,320)
  x2 = random.randint(0,320)
  y1 = random.randint(0,240)
  y2 = random.randint(0,240)
  color = random.randint(0,0xFFFFFF)
  display.drawLine(x1,y1,x2,y2,color)
  display.flush()

display.drawFill(0xFFFFFF)
while True:
  drawRandomLine()
```

This program will clear the screen and then draw random lines infinitely.

Save that file as, say, `__init__.py`.

To upload the file to the Badge, you can clone the [mch2022
tools](https://github.com/badgeteam/mch2022-tools). This repository contains
scripts to upload files to the badge via WebUSB.

Python apps reside in the FatFS partitions inside the badge's internal
flash and/or the optional SD card, so you should use the
`webusb_fat_***` scripts from the tools
project.  Try `python3
tools/webusb_fat_ls.py /`. You will see that the root directory listing
contains two entries: `flash` and `sdcard` (the mount points for the
internal and external partitions).

```
$ python3 webusb_fat_ls.py /
transfer speed: 1045.4196368656173
Directory listing for "/"...
Directory "flash"
Directory "sdcard"
```

### **Warning: Confusion. Pandemonium. Chaos!**

_The paths in the filesystems are different depending on whether you
access them internally via the `os` MicroPython API or whether you adress
them externally via the `webusb_fat...` scripts_

_Internally, i.e. from MicroPython (or native apps) are prefixed with
`sd` if they are located on the optional SD-Card._

_Externally, i.e. from the `webusb_fat...py` scripts, paths pointing to
internal files are prefixed with `flash` and paths pointing to the SD
Card are prefixed with `sdcard`. *_

¯\\ _(ツ)_/¯


## Copy the \_\_init.py__ file.

Call `python3 tools/webusb_fat_push.py <file on your laptop>
<file on The Badge>` to upload your file to the Badge (don't
forget to adjust the path for your laptop). You should see a
progress message and a success message on the terminal and your badge screen.
If you get a Unicode error, you can probably fix it by changing the `fill`
character in the `webusb.py` script (two occurrences).

```bash
$ python webusb_fat_push.py __init__.py /flash/apps/python/myapp/__init__.py
transfer speed: 28560.15516885618
File uploaded
```

After uploading, you should be ready to launch your app on the Badge (`apps` ->
`myapp`) and see colourful lines on the screen. If your script contains errors,
you will typically see a crash message on screen. To see error messages,
connect your serial terminal (see above) to the badge before starting your app.

![Lines!](../lines.jpg)

## Be kind, rewind

Unfortunately, there's no way to end the app yet, so you have to restart your
badge by power cycling it (or using the `webusb_reset.py` script in the `tools`
folder or uploading another file). Let's add that by editing your `__init__.py`
file:

```python
import display
import random
import buttons
import mch22

def reboot(pressed):
  if pressed:
    mch22.exit_python()

buttons.attach(buttons.BTN_A,reboot)

def drawRandomLine():
  x1 = random.randint(0,320)
  x2 = random.randint(0,320)
  y1 = random.randint(0,240)
  y2 = random.randint(0,240)
  color = random.randint(0,0xFFFFFF)
  display.drawLine(x1,y1,x2,y2,color)
  display.flush()

display.drawFill(0xFFFFFF)
while True:
  drawRandomLine()
```

The additional lines will add a key listener that will trigger a reset when the
`A` key is pressed.

Repeat the upload using the `webusb_fat_push.py` script. Restart your app. Done!

## Publish your work!

After you're done writing an amazing app (and writing an amazing `README.md`
with it), share it with others! The [Hatchery](https://mch2022.badge.team) is the
Badge's "App store". You can read about publishing eggs in the hatchery
[here](../../hatchery/).
