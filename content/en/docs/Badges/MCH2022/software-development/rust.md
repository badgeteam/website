     Short description on how to install the tools for Rust development for the ESP32 on the badge
---

## Tools installation

* Rust toolchain from https://github.com/esp-rs/rust-build. Follow the
  instructions given there.
* If you get an error concerning `virtualenv` try uninstalling via `pip` and
  reinstalling via `apt` or vice versa ...
* Install cargo-generate (`cargo install cargo-generate`). If *this* fails, try just running: `rustup update`
* Install the [mch2022 webusb
  tools](https://github.com/badgeteam/mch2022-tools)

## Project workflow

* Create a new project as follows:

```bash
$ cargo generate --git https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-template cargo
ðŸ¤·   Project Name : argh
ðŸ”§   Destination: /MCH2022/rust-build/rust-esp/argh ...

$ cd argh

```


* Generate an app image using:

```bash
# Tell Rust which toolchain to use (you only need to do this once ...)
$ rustup override set esp
info: override toolchain for '/home/<YOUR_USER_NAME>/projects/MCH2022/rust-build/rust-esp/argh' set to 'esp'

# set some environment variables, so rust knows where to find its tools:
# you will probably want to save this in a little 'source' scriptlet ...
export PATH="/home/<YOUR_USER_NAME>/.espressif/tools/xtensa-esp32-elf-gcc/8_4_0-esp-2021r2-patch3-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/bin/:/home/<YOUR_USER_NAME>/.espressif/tools/xtensa-esp32s2-elf-gcc/8_4_0-esp-2021r2-patch3-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/bin/:/home/<YOUR_USER_NAME>/.espressif/tools/xtensa-esp32s3-elf-gcc/8_4_0-esp-2021r2-patch3-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/bin/:$PATH"
export LIBCLANG_PATH="/home/<YOUR_USER_NAME>/.espressif/tools/xtensa-esp32-elf-clang/esp-14.0.0-20220415-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/"


# finally, build the image ...
$ cargo espflash save-image ESP32 rust_esp.img                     
    Updating crates.io index      
  Downloaded filetime v0.2.17     
  Downloaded env_logger v0.9.0
  Downloaded libloading v0.7.3
	... literally download the _entire_ entire internet ...
	...
	... argh
	...

```

* Upload the image using web USB:
```bash
$ webusb_push.py --run rust rust_esp.img
```

## A more elaborate example.

You can find a more elaborate example that drives the display a shows a nice
rust screensaver in [The
Hatchery](https://mch2022.badge.team/projects/small_rust_demo) and on
[github](https://github.com/p2mate/mch2022-rust-app).

I've been told there is some magic involved to [grab control of the
screen](https://github.com/p2mate/mch2022-rust-app/blob/f32aa59a7452311401ac883183e3c6902af808de/src/main.rs#L321)

## Limitations

These instructions use the esp-idf as provided by Espressif so you won't have
access to the components added by the Badge.team. It's probably possible to use
the version provided by the Badge.team, but I have not tried this.

Also: this seems to work on some computers and not on others ... Please feel
free to provide a PR to the documentation or a link to a sample app ... Make
sure you're using the newest version of everything. Throw away your computer
and by a Windows one ...
