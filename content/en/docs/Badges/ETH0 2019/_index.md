## The project

This was a small, simple and most of all very fun badge to make. It's a protoboard for building your own circuits: a true DIY badge!

## Credits

The artwork has been made by Nikolett, the quickly thrown together PCB design was made by Renze and the prototyping board layout was found on the internet. It's an amazing protoboard design made especially for working with SMD components, put online under the CC-BY license by Electronic Eel. You can find his project [here](https://github.com/electroniceel/protoboard).
