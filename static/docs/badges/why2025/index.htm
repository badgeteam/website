  Dear Badge.Team community,
  
  We hereby announce our resignation from the WHY2025 Team:Badge, with immense sadness and regret.
  Unfortunately, recent events have made our collaboration with IFCAT and WHY2025 infeasible.

  The past five weeks have been a tumultuous time for Team:Badge. As some of you may know,
  a team member has been accused of doing things we do not believe they did.
  The process of this conviction did not, in our opinion, meet an acceptable standard for a cohesion issue.
  As we have not been presented with satisfactory evidence, examples, anecdotes, or other reasons for this
  conviction, we cannot stand behind the accusations made against them.

  The overall safety and well-being of friends is more important than volunteering for any event.
  Given the unnecessary stress and grief of this situation-with-no-winners,
  we hereby officially resign from WHY2025 Team:Badge. We wish all the best to the new volunteers that will pick up our tasks,
  as we still believe the visitors of WHY2025 deserve a wonderful experience, and that includes a cool badge.

  Quitting WHY2025 Team:Badge does not mean we will stop being part of Badge.Team altogether,
  as Badge.Team creates badges for other events as well, but we will stop working on the WHY2025 badge.

  Best regards,
    Julian Scheffers (Firmware lead, WHY2025 Team:Badge),
    Anne Jan Brouwer (Co-founder, Badge.Team),
    Joyce Ng (Firmware developer, WHY2025 Team:Badge),
    Renze Nicolai (Hardware lead, WHY2025 Team:Badge),
    Luna (Firmware developer, WHY2025 Team:Badge),
    Jelle Haandrikman (Testing and integration lead, WHY2025 Team:Badge),
    Paul Honig (Hardware designer, WHY2025 Team:Badge),
    Emiel Bart (Documentation Lead, Testing, WHY2025 Team:Badge)
